  # Description
  For this project, I aim to create command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). My main motivation for this project is to create a professional README.md template. Being able to accomplish this app will maximize efficiency while minimizing the time to write out a README.md.
